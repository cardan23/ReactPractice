Why we need to initialize useref function with null?

we need to initialize the function useref like this:
    useref(null);

this is because the "ref_variable.current" object makes
reference to some DOM node, and when we create the ref object
we do not have access to DOM, so react just create it
after the rendering of the component.

If we do not specify a null value into 'useref' we can have unexpected
behavior because this value will be 'undefined'.

    useref() <-- will set undefined instead null

This might be a design issue in react, we need to specify always null as a default
value into ref objects.
