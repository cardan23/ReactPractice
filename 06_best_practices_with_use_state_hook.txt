Best practices about the use of state hood in React

1. avoid to use reduntant state variables
2. Group related variables inside an object
3. Avoid deeply nested structures (becomes complicated to update)
4. keep components pure (pure in javascript means, with the same input always returns the same response)

5. If we want to share one value into 2 component we need to manage this with the parent of the two components,
and pass this value to both. This is the only way the components can share information.
