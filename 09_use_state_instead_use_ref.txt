We can use 'useState' instead 'useRef' for the forms
a lot of people thinks this is an issue, is NOT, we can work with that aproach.

UseState will render the component with every change but
Unless we notice a big change into performance of the application we should change to use 
useRef but its correct to use 'useState' too. 

If we have a complex web page with a lot of elements and we can notice issues on performance
then we can change to useref but most of the cases we are not going to experiment that.

 I prefer to use 'useRef' because its easier to manage but its important to know
 what are the different apoproaches to resolve the same.
