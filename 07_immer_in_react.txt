Immer in React

Immer is a library to copy objects and  not affect the original,
this is used to avoid the use of spread operator (...) and do it easier.

So to install immer we can use the next commnad:

    nom i immer@latest

To modify the properties of a copied object we can modify it with 'produce' function
and with sintaxis like javascript (see immer video into documentation, managing component state section)
